# Quick access to the BlackBoard platform (Bocconi University)

All the Bocconi students know how annoying it is that you cannot directly access BBoard by just digiting http://blackboard.unibocconi.it/ inside the URL bar. If we have just opened our browser, that link will redirect us to the You@B log in page. Opening the BlackBoard platform is thus not straightforward and it requires at least two steps: you can access BBoard only after you have successfully logged into your Agenda You@B.

This program lets you save time by doing it all for you. It will open your Agenda You@B, perform the Log In, and then instantly open BBoard.
